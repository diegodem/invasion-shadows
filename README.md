# Invasion of the Shadows
Invasion of the Shadows is a short 3D top-down adventure game. Its main objective is to defeat the Shadows that have invaded the Farm while looking for the Big Shadow, who is the biggest and strongest Shadow.
In order to find the Big Shadow, the player must climb the Mountain that is placed at the North of the Farm.

The combat with the Shadows happens in real time. The Shadows will approach the player when they sense his presence, and will attack him with darkness. Meanwhile, the player must attack the shadows pressing the ENTER key. When the combat ends, after 3 seconds since the last time the player was damaged, its health starts recovering slowly.

There are 2 buildings in the map, the barn and the house. The player can enter both of them. Additionally, the house has 2 floors.

The project is composed of 5 scenes, which are:
- StartScene (Just the title of the game).
- IntroScene (An introduction to the story and the controls of the game).
- VillageScene (The actual gameplay scene).
- GameOverScene (Self-explanatory).
- VictoryScene (The scene with the final message and the credits, when the player defeats the final boss).

Features:
- 3D game with a third person perspective.
- 3D combat system.
- The characteristics of the ThirdPersonController have been adjusted and modified to adapt it to the gameplay.
- The enemies have a simple AI, but sufficient for its purpose. They can follow the player around even when there's not a straight path between them or when climbing the mountain.
- The game could easily be enlarged, with more maps and more kinds of enemies.
